# Car Races

This project will take us to the stands of the Le Mans track. Cars are generated with random
speed and random delay, all to keep the fan in thrill until the last moment. I used the C++
threads, mutex, condition_variable and ncurses libraries.

To compile:

`g++ main.cpp -lncurses -o main`
